# Runic

Game for game jam. Theme is "what does this button do?". Optional restriction is "60 seconds to win"

Current idea: a combination of the games Tunic and Half-Minute Hero (both of which I have not played lol)

Finished game on 8/17:
* The idea is interesting, but would've liked to flesh it out more. Also re-used a previous art pack from a different game jam, for next jam it would be good to try a different pack or make my own art
* A few more mechanics/more expansive levels would be cool too
* Admittedly, making another platformer started to feel uninspiring. Would probably try a different genre next time
